Compiling the sdl-buzz-quiz:

Requirements:
* As the sdl-buzz-quiz uses SDL, sdl needs to be installed on your system.
* sdl-config should be available as the makefile uses it to query paths
* The quiz uses TTF-fonts. SDL_TTF is required.

* The quiz uses RapidXML to read XML. As the source file is
  not included, you have to download it, yourself, from:
  http://rapidxml.sourceforge.net/
  Place "rapidxml.hpp" in the root project directory

* I like the font family liberation, so this is used
  in the quiz. It is not included, so you have to download it,
  yourself, from:
  https://fedorahosted.org/liberation-fonts/
  place "LiberationSans-Regular.ttf" in the root project
  directoy.
  If you'd like to use other fonts, you have to replace
  the filename in the source file (may become 
  config option in the future)

* and - obviously, you should have a working C++ compiler and linker
* Although this is no requirement, using the Makefile really
  should be the simplest way to build the game. Obviously,
  you need make to do so.
  
  
Once the requirements are met, a simple "make" in the
root project directory should suffice to build the binary.

There are only a few questions included in this repository - just enough to test the game and
have an idea of the xml file format. You should add some more questions depending
on the desired scope of the game.
